# Final Project: NeoCode Course System with Attendance Management using Fingerprint Technology and Student Performance

## Project Description:

The project aims to develop a system for a course named NeoCode, focusing on efficient student attendance management using raspberrypy technology with fingerprint readers. This system will record both entry and exit times for students. Additionally, it will integrate with Django, Python, and SQL to provide teachers with additional tools to evaluate student performance.

## Key Features:

1. **Attendance Management**: Utilization of raspberrypy with fingerprint readers to efficiently and accurately record student attendance.

2. **User Profiles**: Users will be categorized into three types: admin, students, and teachers. Each user type will have access to specific functions and their own customized profile.

3. **Performance Observations**: Teachers can add observations about student performance, visible only to other teachers. Similarly, students can add observations about teachers.

## Additional Features:

1. **Data Analysis**: Interactive reports on attendance trends.

2. **Report Generation**: Development of interactive reports with graphs and tables displaying attendance and student performance. For example, bar charts comparing average class attendance.

3. **Automatic Notifications**: Implementation of a notification system to inform students about their attendance and teachers about student performance updates.

4. **Educational Social Networks**: Functionality allowing students and teachers to interact and collaborate similarly to a social network, sharing resources, participating in discussions, and forming learning communities.

5. **Virtual Assistant**: A virtual assistant capable of responding to frequently asked questions from students and teachers.

6. **Mini Game**: Players control a duck that must catch falling bugs. The goal is to catch as many bugs as possible before they reach the ground.

## Technologies Used:

-  Raspberrypy with fingerprint readers
- Django, Python, and SQL for web development
